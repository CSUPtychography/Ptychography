# Getting Started with Git #

### Install git ###

Go [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
to learn how to install git on whatever platform you're using.

Update your identity using
`git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
and `git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`.
You may also wish to [specify a default editor](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Editor).

### Clone the repository ###

Run `git clone https://robthereticent@bitbucket.org/robthereticent/ptychography.git`
to clone this repository into a new directory.
(This will create a directory called 'ptychography'
with this repository inside.)
This URL is shown at the top of the page.
See
[this guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
for more info.

### Make some Commits ###

There are four places a file can be: the working directory, the staging area,
the local repository, and the remote repository.

When making changes, only the working directory is modified.
These changes can then be staged for commit using `git add`.
The status of the staging area can be seen with `git status`,
and the exact changes made can be seen with `git diff` or `git diff --staged`.

Once changes have been staged, they can be committed to the local repository
with `git commit`.
**Be sure to specify a [good commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).**

### Push the changes ###

When some changes have been committed,
the remote repository should be updated with `git push`.
`git push origin master` may have to be run the first time
to specify which remote (origin) and which branch (master).
[details](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes)

If the remote repository has changed, `git push` will fail.
Use `git pull --rebase` (*not* `git pull`) to update the local repository
with changes from the remote.
After fixing any
[conflicts](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#Basic-Merge-Conflicts),
run `git push` again as normal.

### History and Undoing things ###

Commit history can be viewed with `git log` or `git log --oneline`.
Which commits to show can be specified in a number of ways,
see [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) or `git help log`.

Commits can (should) only be changed in the local repository.
Commits that have been pushed to the remote repo
should not be changed to avoid conflicts.
See
[How to undo things](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Undoing-Things)
to learn how to undo things.
The difference between `reset` and `revert` can be somewhat mysterious.
[This](https://git-scm.com/2011/07/11/reset.html) or
[this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/resetting-checking-out-and-reverting)
may help de-mystify.

 * [Set up SSH keys](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-ssh-for-git-728138079.html)
 * [Learn about branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
 * [Lots more tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection)
